Hi 👋,

> I'm craig ([@hobochild](https://github.com/hobochild)), I love long walks and building things. I'm currently taking a three month break to work on my 🏄 in South Africa. Before that I lived on a boat on the canals of London and worked for [beryl](https://beryl.cc) and [balena](https://balena.io), you can reach me [here](mailto:hobochildster@gmail.com) ✌️.
