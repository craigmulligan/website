#  [pep 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)

A virtual-env does the following. 

1. Sets a simlink (or copies) to your global python bin.
2. Resets your `PATH` environment to first search the local bin directory. 
3. The purpose of this is so that when python launches it search the packages relative to the binary rather the system site packages.

`pep 582` proposes putting packages in a `__pypackages__` folder relative to the project and then set that in `sys.path[1] == './__pypackages__/3.8/lib'`. This similar to the way node.js resolves packages by first looking in `./node_modules`. 

How does it differ from node.js resolution?
 
* Node.js keeps looking in `node_modules` until it reaches the root, python will just look in `./__pypackages__`.
