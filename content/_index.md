# Hi 👋,

## I'm Craig ([@hobochild](https://github.com/hobochild)), I <mark>love</mark> trying to build complex systems with <mark>simple software</mark>.

I'm currently in lock down on the east coast of 🇿🇦. Before that I lived on the canals of London, where I worked for [beryl](https://beryl.cc/) and [balena](https://balena.io/).

Right now I'm contracting remotely & focusing on my 🏄.

If you'd like to work with me or simply chat you can reach me [here](mailto:website@hobochild.com) ✌️.
