I'm a senior engineer who loves writing tests, working in tight knit teams and making the world a little better through code.

I've lived and worked in South Africa, the UK and now the US. I'm currently working for [Fullsend](https://fullsend.io) and based in NYC.

My work experiences are listed below, but I'm also always tinkering on [my own experiments](/now).
 
# Experience

### [Fullsend](https://fullsend.io) 

<small>June 2023 - present</small>

Fullsend is a small "do it all" agency based out of Santa Monica. As a fullstack engineer, Iâ€™ve led diverse consumer-facing initiatives spanning journalism, telemedicine, web3, and generative AI spaces. Each engagement is unique, but typically I've been embedded in a larger team helping accelerate them towards their specific goals. While adept at adapting to various tech stacks, React, Next.js, and TypeScript have been recurring tools amongst client projects.

### [Beryl](https://beryl.cc) 

<small>February 2018 - June 2022</small>

Beryl is one of the UK's biggest micro-mobility platforms. During my 4 years there, I helped build out the core product and scale it to our first 1 million rides. This involved setting up our infrastructure and CI with Helm & GCP Kubernetes, writing our microservices using Python & Flask, implementing a GraphQL API gateway and building out UIs in React & React-Native. I worked across the stack from the component library all the way to our data services using BigQuery, DBT & Looker.

Later, I led larger projects, like, expanding our systems to cater to multiple vehicle types, migrating our mechanics tasking service to ServiceNow using dual-writes and feature flags as well as changing our core state machines and APIâ€™s to be inline with the micro-mobility industry's MDS standard.

I spent a year as engineering team lead where I was the direct line manager for 8 engineers, splitting my time between coding, stakeholder meetings, spec'ing features with senior engineers and pairing with juniors.

### [balena.io](https://balena.io) 

<small>November 2014 - November 2017</small>

Balena.io is a PAAS that enables developers update and manage embedded Linux devices.

I joined Balena early and wore many hats through my time there.

Mostly I was involved in developer relations. Building out documentation, example projects and advocating for the product at meetups & conferences.

I also contributed to the frontend stack. Helping to maintain [most](https://etcher.io/) [of](https://balenaos.io/) the [websites](https://www.balena.io/) and the [component library](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/rendition).

### [Firing Squad](http://firingsquad.co.za/)

<small>November 2013 -  November 2014</small>

Firing Squad was a digital agency building WordPress sites for some of South Africa's largest companies including Dimension Data, CondÃ© Nast and PWC.

I got my start at Firing Squad, converting PSDs to custom WordPress themes and maintaining some big custom WordPress installs.
