I'm a senior engineer who loves writing tests, working in tight knit teams and making the world a little better through code.

Over the last year, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to travel all over the world while dedicating my energy to small projects that explore my interests like [machine learning](https://craigmulligan.com/posts/crowdfactor/), [databases](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql), [cycling](https://github.com/RespectableThieves/hypecycle) and [augmented reality](https://craigmulligan.com/posts/brainfuckar)

I now live in Los Angeles and work for [Fullsend](https://fullsend.io)
 
# Experience

### [Fullsend](https://fullsend.io) 

<small>June 2023 - present</small>

Fullsend is a small do it all agency based out of Santa Monica. I've been working as a fullstack engineer on projects in the AI and web3 space.

### [Beryl](https://beryl.cc) 

<small>February 2018 - June 2022</small>


Beryl is one of the UK's biggest micro-mobility platforms. During my 4 years there, I helped build out the core product and scaled it to our first 1 million rides. This involved setting up our infrastructure and CI with Helm & GCP Kubernetes, writing our microservices using Python & Flask, implementing a GraphQL API gateway and building out UIs in React & React-Native. I worked across the stack from the component library all the way to our data services using BigQuery, DBT & Looker.

Later, I led larger projects, like, expanding our systems to cater to multiple vehicle types, migrating our mechanics tasking service to ServiceNow using dual-writes and feature flags as well as changing our core state machines and APIâ€™s to be inline with the micro-mobility industry's MDS standard.

I also spent a year as engineering team lead where I was the direct line manager for 8 engineers, splitting my time between coding, stakeholder meetings, spec'ing features with senior engineers and pairing with juniors.

### [balena.io](https://balena.io) 

<small>November 2014 - November 2017</small>

Balena.io is a PAAS that enables developers update and manage embedded Linux devices.

> I joined Balena early and wore many hats through my time there.

Mostly I was involved in developer relations. Building out documentation, example projects and advocating for the product at meetups & conferences.

I also contributed to the frontend stack. Helping to maintain [most](https://etcher.io/) [of](https://balenaos.io/) the [websites](https://www.balena.io/) and the [component library](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/rendition).
