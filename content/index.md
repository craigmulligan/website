Hi 👋,

I'm craig ([@hobochild](https://github.com/hobochild)), I love trying to build complex systems with simple software.

I'm currently in lock down on the east coast of 🇿🇦. Before that I lived on the canals of London, where I worked for [beryl](https://beryl.cc/) and [balena](https://balena.io/).

I'm currently contracting & focusing on my 🏄.

If you'd like to work with me or simply chat you can reach me [here](mailto:website@hobochild.com) ✌️.
