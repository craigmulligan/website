# Beehint 

I've been playing [NYT's spellingbee game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) for a few months. It's super fun, but often challenging enough to need hints. Unfortunately, they present the hints in a [format](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/25/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum.html) that is cumbersome to read. 

It often takes time and skills unrelated to game to work out which type of words are still left in play. Beehint is a browser extension which makes NYT's spellingbee hints easier to read.

Beehint will load the hints and place them in the game view, using your currently guessed words to work out which hints are still left.
