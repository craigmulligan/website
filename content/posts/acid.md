Whenever I have been asked by another developer about what ACID in relation to databases are, I have always had a bit of a hand wavy definition, describing it as the important things that database handles which you don't have to think about as an application developer I'll then go on to describe a transactions and durability via backups. Today I was re-reading the ACID chapter [designing data-intensive applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) as research for my [toysql project](https://github.com/hobochild/toysql) and I thought I'd write a post to improve my future recall and definition.
