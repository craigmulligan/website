Lately I've been been picking up alot of "useless" skills. 
By useless I mean that they don't provide any economic value to me or anyone else, and there is no reason for me to learn them other than curiousity and the act of learning.

Recently I spent sometime building [a database from scratch](), it's still pretty basic but I learn some new things and felt that uncomfortable feeling when you don't understand something.  

I don't mean to say there are no uses to these skills but there is very little rational reason for me to learn these specific skills. But I've been throughly enjoying
