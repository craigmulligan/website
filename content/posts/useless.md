Lately I've been been picking up alot of "useless" skills.

By useless I mean that they don't provide any economic value to me or anyone else, and there is no reason for me to learn them other than curiousity and the act of learning.

Because this is all for fun. I don't have to be hard on my self if I'm struggling or I find the "skill" boring. I can just move onto something else if I'm not enjoying it.

I've typically been picking things up that have a steep but short learning curve. This gives me that statisfying feeling of grokking something without sinking too much time into it.

Here are some examples of skills I've learnt recently. 

__NOTE__: I haven't mastered any of these things. I've just learnt enough to get the enjoyment and confidence from initial learning curve. For instance I can juggle 3 balls, I haven't tried 4. I might in the future but it'll likely give me diminishing returns over learning an entirely new skill.
