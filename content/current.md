I have a few projects on the go.

# [Leaflet](https://github.com/craigmulligan/leaflet)

Leaflet is a tool to help you eat more plant based meals.

# [Toysql](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql)

For the last couple months I've been building a [toy database](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql). It's a primitive sqlite clone written from scratch in python. 

I've always had a hazy ideas about database internals and this is giving me the opportunity to clarify those ideas.

# [CrowdFactor](/posts/crowdfactor/)

Crowd Factor uses surf cameras to help you predict crowds at your local surfspot.
