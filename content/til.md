# Today I learnt

> This is a list of superficial but interesting facts I've come across. I've tried my best to verify these but some of them might be a better story than fact.

- 2023-10-08: [Fish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerecis), namely code, can be used as human skin replacement for skin grafts.
- 2023-09-20: There is a [theory on the origin of bagels](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/bagel-history-jewish-american-culture-symbol#:~:text=Another%20bagel%20origin%20story%20tells,bread%2C%20began%20boiling%20it%20instead.) that bakers in 9th century Prussia or Poland who, hampered by antisemitic law that forbade them from baking their bread, began boiling it instead.
- 2023-08-18: The golfing term ["bogey"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)#Bogey>), originally signified the number of strokes it should take for a good player to complete the designated hole, it was based on the term bogey man, old Scottish for ghost or spirit. The notion being that each player was scoring against a hypothetical bogey man. However, in 1898 when the rubber golf ball was invented, balls would travel farther and holes would generally require one fewer stoke, a new term "par" was introduced and bogey then denoted one over par.
- 2023-08-05: Some of the [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) from which they get their namesakes are still active. The "John Frum V" cult, started during WII while the American soldiers were stationed on the island. Vast amounts of supplies were air dropped, which meant drastic changes to the lifestyle of the islanders. Cult members worshiped certain unspecified Americans having the name "John Frum" or "Tom Navy" who they claimed had brought cargo to their island during World War II and whom they identified as being the spiritual entity who would provide cargo to them in the future. In attempts to get cargo to fall by parachute or land in planes or ships again, islanders imitated the same practices they had seen the military personnel use. Cult behaviors usually involved mimicking the day-to-day activities and dress styles of US soldiers, such as performing parade ground drills with wooden or salvaged rifles. In a form of sympathetic magic, many built life-size replicas of airplanes out of straw and cut new military-style landing strips out of the jungle, hoping to attract more airplanes.
- 2023-07-11: [The Spanish Peso or Dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar#:~:text=The%20Spanish%20peso,quotations%20until%202001.) was cut radially into 8 pieces to form change. These pieces were colloquially called bits. This still lingers today with term 2 bits (12.5 x 2 = 25) referring to a quarter. It's an interesting coincidence that computers use 8-bit bytes too.

In May 2007, a 15 m (49 ft) specimen caught off the Alaskan coast was discovered with the 90 mm (3.5 in) head of an explosive bomb lance of a model manufactured between 1879 and 1885, so the whale was probably bomb lanced sometime between those years, and its age at the time of death was estimated at between 115 and 130 years. Spurred by this discovery, scientists measured the ages of other bowhead whales; one specimen was estimated to be 211 years old.
- 2023-03-18: A coal mine fire has been burning beneath the town of [Centralia Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania) since 1962. The town's population has declined from 1,000 in 1980 to five residents in 2020. The town is in an anthracite coal belt, a coal which is 95% carbon and so the fire is incredibly hard to put out.

At least 7000 people who were deemed to be insufficiently grief-stricken were executed, although the killing was not restricted to humans: cows were slaughtered so that their calves would know what losing a mother felt like. Shaka was killed by three assassins sometime later in that year of mourning.
- 2023-03-03: [Olga Boberg](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Boberg) was a famous doorkeeper at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. Students used to send her postcards from their trips abroad. It became so popular that it was enough to write "Olga, Sweden" for her to get the letters.

During the last three decades of the eighteenth century, the price of watches declined and consequently they increased in popularity. William Pitt, the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, decided to tax watches and clocks. The tax reduced the number of time pieces in circulation and so clocks quickly appeared on buildings and in public places. These timepieces, usually large in size and of relatively plain design, were known as [‘Act of Parliament Clocks’ or 'Tavern Clocks'](https://www.fairfaxhouse.co.uk/articles/tavern-clock-taxing-time/). The tax was universally unpopular and repealed in less than a year.

- 2022-12-20: Map makers add fictious features like [Trap Streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street) or [Phantom towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_settlement) to protect themselves against plagary. In one case, Agloe, New York, was invented on a 1930s map as a copyright trap. In 1950, a general store was built there and named Agloe General Store, as that was the name seen on the map.

- 2022-11-22: 9 states in the USA implement the [Idaho stop law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop), which allows cyclists to treat traffic lights as stop signs and stop signs as yields, meaning that they can ride through both if it is safe to do so.
- 2022-11-11: A standard cup of coffee requires **[140 litres](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report14_1.pdf) of water** to produce. Most of which is used to grow the coffee plant itself.

He took them all and had a short burst of energy, but then entered into a state of delirium, and lost consciousness. Koivunen remembered waking up the following morning, separated from his patrol and having no supplies. In the following days, he escaped Soviet forces once again, was injured by a land mine which also set fire to a nearby Russian camp, and lay in a ditch for a week waiting for help. Having skied more than 400 km (248.5 mi) he was found and admitted to a nearby hospital, where his heart rate was measured at 200 beats per minute, triple the average human heartbeat and weighing only 43 kg (94.8 lbs). In the week Koivunen was gone, he subsisted only on pine buds and a single Siberian jay that he caught and ate raw. He ended up surviving and died peacefully at the age of 71.
- 2022-10-28: [The United States Egg industry has been successfully sued for making false claims about the misleading claims about the healthiness of eggs.](https://nutritionfacts.org/2014/03/06/egg-industry-caught-making-false-claims/) [Since the 1960s](https://bitesizevegan.org/the-great-egg-conspiracy-lies-corruption-kevin-bacon/) the National Commission on Egg nutrition have run false adverts, funded studies which were deliberately designed to distort facts about cholesterol, eggs and their relationship to health.
- 2022-10-20: [Vanilla cultivation is interesting.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla) Only 1% of wild Vanilla will pollinate. This is because their flower only opens for one day and it only has one known pollinator, orchid bees. For this reason all commercial pollination takes place via hand pollination, a technique first discovered in 1819 by Edmond Albius who was a 12 year old slave from Reunion islands at the time.

This is advantageous to the plant because birds don't have molars like mammals which destroy the seeds and prevent germination. Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse.
- 2022-09-23: [Research](https://bigthink.com/life/cats-find-cat-people-disturbing/) suggests that cats are more likely to dislike cat people. Reasoning that cat-people are less likely to follow cat best practices. Like waiting for a cat to approach them and only stroking them in specific areas.

- 2022-06-15: In Britain, the initial postal pricing structure was confusing. Costs depended on the number of pages sent, distance & the distance they travelled, also the receiver of the post would pay the fee. Several techniques developed to get around this like writing [crossed ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter#/media/File:From_Caroline_Weston_to_Deborah_Weston;_Friday,_March_3,_1837_p3.jpg) to reduce the number of pages or hiding a message on the outside of the letter so receiver could reject the post without paying but still get the "message".

Who knows how much of that will be replaced with cobalt and lithium as batteries become more common place in industry, but it's likely good news for the earth.
- 2022-05-14: [Early Greek & Latin texts employed "Scriptio continua"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio_continua), which is the style of writing without punctuation or spaces. Usually texts were read as performance pieces and so quick parsing wasn't concern. The reader had the liberty to insert pauses and dictate tone, making the act of reading a significantly more subjective activity than it is today. However, the lack of spacing also led to some ambiguity because a minor discrepancy in word parsing could give the text a different meaning. For example, a phrase written in scriptio continua as collectamexiliopubem may be interpreted as collectam ex Ilio pubem, meaning "a people gathered from Troy", or collectam exilio pubem, "a people gathered for exile". Thus, readers had to be much more cognisant of the context to which the text referred. Later, this evolved to [“boustrophedon”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon), which included lines written in alternating directions.
- 2022-05-01: [The raw metals in a USA nickel cost ~9 cents](https://www.ft.com/content/2b97227c-07c2-4c69-9db4-9e19f87a9a79) so you'd almost double the value by melting down and selling the coin instead of trading with it, though it is illegal to export, melt or treat either a five-cent or one cent coin.

Coca-Cola agreed to sell its syrup to bottlers at a fixed price in perpetuity, thinking bottling was just a fad. Then, when the company managed to renegotiate, there was so much five-cent price advertising and so many vending machines that only accepted nickels that it took another couple of decades before Coca-Cola could break the nickel’s spell. Since then Arizona Ice tea have maintained there 99c price for 30 years. Side note the Arizona ice-tea founders had never stepped foot in Arizona when launching the brand.
- 2022-04-08: [The Lobster War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster_War) was a dispute over spiny lobsters that occurred from 1961 to 1963 between Brazil and France. The Brazilian government refused to allow French fishing vessels to catch spiny lobsters 160 km off Brazil's northeastern coast by arguing that lobsters "crawl along the continental shelf." However, the French maintained that "lobsters swim" and so they could be caught by any fishing vessel from any country. The situation became very tense once the French rejected that demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put its many ships on a state of alert. The dispute was resolved unilaterally by Brazil, which extended its territorial waters to a 370 km zone and took in the disputed lobsters' bed.

- 2022-01-06: [Goose egg addling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_egg_addling) is a wildlife management method of population control for Canada geese and other bird species. The process of addling involves temporarily removing fertilized eggs from the nest, testing for embryo development, terminating embryo development, and placing the egg back in the nest. Returning the egg to the nest misleads the goose into believing the egg is still developing. Otherwise, the goose would begin laying again. Goose egg addling was predominantly used in the aftermath of the plane crash of US Airways Flight 1549 on January 15, 2009. Following an investigation by officials, which determined the plane crash was caused by a bird strike of Canada geese, an estimated 1,739 goose eggs were coated with oil in an effort to prevent any similar incidents from occurring. There is an interesting [document](http://www.okanagangooseplan.com/files/HSUS_CanadaGooseEggAddlingProtocol_2004.pdf) which details all you need to know about addling. From defending oneself from the geese with umbrellas and trash cans, the float test to determine if the embryo is fertilized to alternate termination strategies to oiling method like using dummy eggs.
- 2021-12-27: [The Gospel of Matthew is the only one of the four canonical gospels to mention the Magi (aka the Three wise men)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi). The gospel never mentions the number of Magi.
