#### Some kind words from my colleagues:

> Craig is the friendly 10x’er next door. Cool, calm, collected with an epic South African accent to boot. There are rumblings from the larger team that he might be the most talented programmer to don the Fullsend Jersey. </br><sup><sub>[Sawyer Billings](https://open.substack.com/pub/sawyerbillings/p/at-the-metal-4-the-fullsend-jersey?selection=2b823716-458b-4555-8ca0-f8c7920d5979&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web)</sub></sup>

> I want to take this moment to say that @Craig’s instincts on inscrutable bugs is absolutely world class and I herby grant him knighthood (royal order of Bucks-town). </br><sup><sub>[Matt Buckley](https://www.smalldevshop.co/about.html)</sub></sup>
