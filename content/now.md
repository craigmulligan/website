I have a personal projects I've worked on recently 

# [Vibes](https://github.com/craigmulligan/mapbox-navigation-machine)

This is google maps clone that gives you directions via haptic feedback. The idea being that you can get around a city without taking a phone out of your pocket.  

# [HypeCycle](https://github.com/RespectableThieves/hypecycle)

This is an open-source cycling computer I'm building with my [brother](https://www.shaunmulligan.com/) 

# [BrainfuckAR](posts/brainfuckar)

This is an exploration in how one could program in the real world with the aid of AR. I chose a simple to implement language and created an augmented reality IDE.

# [Toysql](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql)

For the last couple months I've been building a [toy database](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql). It's a primitive sqlite clone written from scratch in python. 

I've always had a hazy ideas about database internals and this is giving me the opportunity to clarify those ideas.

# [CrowdFactor](/posts/crowdfactor/)

Crowd Factor uses surf cameras to help you predict crowds at your local surfspot.

# [Leaflet](https://github.com/craigmulligan/leaflet)

Leaflet is a tool to help you eat more plant based meals.
