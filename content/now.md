I'm currently living in Brooklyn and working for [Norm.ai](https://norm.ai). Below you can find some of my more recent side projects, tools and experiments.

### [Leaflet](https://github.com/craigmulligan/leaflet)

Leaflet is a tool to help you eat more plant based meals.

### [CrowdFactor](/posts/crowdfactor/)

Crowd Factor uses surf cameras to help you predict crowds at your local surfspot.

### [Fire](https://github.com/craigmulligan/js-fire)

A port of google's python-fire to javascript.

### [Speckled](https://github.com/craigmulligan/speckled)

WIP - An LLM agent that generates and executes e2e tests for web apps.

### [Standup](https://github.com/craigmulligan/standup)

WIP - Using LLM's to generate standup meeting notes from your git history.

> The following projects are not actively maintained.

### [BrainfuckAR](posts/brainfuckar)

This is an exploration in how one could program in the real world with the aid of AR. I chose a simple to implement language and created an augmented reality IDE.

## [Beehint](/posts/beehint)

[Beehint](/posts/beehint) is a browser extension which makes NYT's spellingbee hints easier to read.

### [Vibes](https://github.com/craigmulligan/mapbox-navigation-machine)

This is google maps clone that gives you directions via haptic feedback. Google maps has this feature built in, but this was a good exercise in building a navigation machine.

### [HypeCycle](https://github.com/RespectableThieves/hypecycle)

This is an open-source cycling computer I'm building with my [brother](https://www.shaunmulligan.com/)

### [Toysql](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql)

For the last couple months I've been building a [toy database](https://github.com/craigmulligan/toysql). It's a primitive sqlite clone written from scratch in python.

I've always had a hazy ideas about database internals and this is giving me the opportunity to clarify those ideas.

### [Occupied](https://hackster.io/craigmulligan/occupied-507dc6)

My first flat share in London was a three story with 6 people and one bathroom, so running down the stairs to check if the bathroom was occupied became a common annoyance for everyone in the house. I [hooked up a raspberrypi to a reed-switch](https://hackster.io/craigmulligan/occupied-507dc6) with a fancy front-end to text people when it's their turn for the bathroom.

> You can also take a look at some small [tools](/tools) I have built.
