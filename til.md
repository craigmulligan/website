# Today I Learnt

* 2021-12-27: [The Gospel of Matthew is the only one of the four canonical gospels to mention the Magi (aka the Three wise men)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi). The gospel never mentions the number of Magi. Still, most western Christian denominations have traditionally assumed them to have been three in number, based on the statement that they brought three gifts. In Eastern Christianity, especially the Syriac churches, the Magi often number twelve.
* 2021-12-23: [There is no wifi and cell phone signal in Green Bank West Virginia, Resident's who live within 10 miles of the Green Bank observatory are banned from Bluetooth devices and microwaves, unless they are contained in a metal box, known as a Faraday cage, which blocks electromagnetic fields](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/green-bank-west-virginia-quiet-zone.html). I worked at snowshoe a ski resort within the national quiet zone and it had restrictions on cell service but there was (very bad) wifi. The resort obviously doesn't advertise this so it was interesting to see how people coped without their phones, most arrived in late and in a mood because the couldn't load google maps and couldn't call the hotel for directions either.
* 2021-12-15: [Every one of 850+ Wetherspoon's pubs](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/10/wetherspoons-carpet-tumblr-blog) has a unique carpet specifically designed for each location. The [makers](https://www.axminster-carpets.co.uk/23-royal-warrant) of the carpets also have a royal warrant which means carpets for the queen & Wetherspoons come from the same place. 
* 2021-12-07: [10% of US electricity for the last two decades was generated from old Russian nuclear warheads.](https://www.npr.org/2013/12/11/250007526/megatons-to-megawatts-russian-warheads-fuel-u-s-power-plants).
* 2021-12-05: The [Dewey decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) heavily favors Christianity, dedicating nearly all of the 200 division to it: the world's thousands of other religions were listed under the 290s. For example, Islam is under just DDC 297, despite being almost as large as Christianity by population. There are other biases for example: some categories regarding women were adjacent to categories on etiquette and in 1932 topics relating to homosexuality were first added to the system under 132 (mental derangements) and 159.9 (abnormal psychology). In 1996, homosexuality was added to 306.7 (sexual relations); this remains the preferred location in the current edition. Although books can also be found under 616.8583 (sexual practices viewed as medical disorders).
* 2021-12-02: [clickers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clicker), commonly used to train dogs, were used in World War II by Allied paratroopers preceding and during Operation Overlord as a way of covertly identifying friend from foe. A soldier would click once and if two clicks were received in return from an unidentifiable soldier then his identification was confirmed. (Seems like an easy code to crack.)
* 2021-12-01: In the wake of Napster (2000), [Rednex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rednex), the swedish band behind "cotten eye joe", outlined a new strategy to become a entertainment group rather than a band. This meant they'd hire different artists in different regions (Australasia, Europe, America) to perform their songs live increasing their concert revenue.
* 2021-11-26: The [Apgar score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score) is a quick way for doctors to evaluate the health of all newborns at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. My mother told me in med school they used the Apgar score to evaluate men too. 
* 2021-11-24: [17th century Japanese Fire Fighters](https://listverse.com/2016/08/05/10-surprising-facts-about-firefighters) would wet their uniforms to be come less flammable then with hooks and polls try pull down the building in order to smother the fire.
* 2021-11-22: [Company gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company%27s_Garden) in get's it namesake from the Dutch East India company. They farmed fresh produce for ships passing by as well as the local settlement.
* 2021-11-12: [The lena image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) widely used as a standard in the field of digital image processing since 1973, when it was used in developing the jpeg, is from a Playboy centrefold of a Playboy Magazine. Later Lena, the model, worked for Kodak and became a [Shirley girl](https://www.wired.com/story/finding-lena-the-patron-saint-of-jpegs/) which was a photo card sent to Kodak printers to standardise film prints.

A Mufti is an [Islamic Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufti). As of writing this some schools in NZ have changed the name of their casual clothes day. 
* 2021-10-31: [A milkman in Cornwall has saved a row of shops by dousing a fire with 320 pints of milk.](https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-30037484.html)

* 2021-10-22: The inventor of the boogey board was a qualified mathematician from USC. He invented a bunch of other things like the remove-able fin system and a board that you could break into 3 for traveling.
* 2021-10-20: There used to be laws up till as late as the early 2000s which meant margarine had to be coloured (pink) or couldn't be coloured yellow (to mimic butter). #99p. 
* 2021-10-19: The Irish main diet prior to potatoes, for ~1000 years was dairy & oats. Perhaps the reason I can stomach so many milkshakes.
